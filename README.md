HostsWidget
====================

Purpose
---------------------

I got fed up of hacking my hosts file and having to flush my DNS cache manually, so wrote a small dashboard widget to be able to add/toggle entries in the hosts file and flush the DNS cache by pressing a button.

Installation
---------------------
Install in the same way that Dashboard Widgets normally are installed: double-click on the widget and choose to "Keep" it!

Compatibility
---------------------

Works in Leopard and Snow Leopard, using an Applescript to the things that need admin privileges (i.e. flushing the DNS cache).  There's a problem in Lion that the prompt to enter your account credentials appears on your main desktop and not on the Dashboard screen. (This is rectified by unticking "Show Dashboard as a space" in the Mission Control section of the System Preferences.
